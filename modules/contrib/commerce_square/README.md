# Commerce Square Connect

Square is the payment / POS company making commerce easy and accessible to 
everyone. This module integrates their Connect APIs for online payments and 
inventory into Drupal Commerce 2.x.

## Getting started

Review [Square APIs: Getting Started] to get your Square account, application, 
and sandbox access configured.

## Square Payment Form

This module provides a Drupal Commerce payment gateway that integrates with 
[Square Payment Form]. This allows you to collect payment using your Square 
account online.

See [Testing using the API sandbox] to test the integration.

Remember: Your *Personal Access Token* is for OAuth integrations (currently not 
implemented.)

In order to test the Square Payment Form you must use the *Sandbox Application 
ID* and *Sandbox Access Token* provided in your application.
